The purpose of `com.tjluoma.di-auto.sh` is to create a `launchd` plist which will run [di-auto.sh](https://github.com/tjluoma/di/blob/master/di-auto.sh) once a day with the `--update` flag, which will automatically look for all updates using the `di-` scripts, but only for apps which are already installed.
